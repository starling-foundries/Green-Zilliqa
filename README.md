The Green Zilliqa Initiative exists to put forward blockchain solutions to the climate change problem. First by neutralizing the PoW footprint of the Zilliqa mainchain. This is done via the accepted practice of buying and burning a selected crop of carbon offsets. In our case, in order to encourage broad and diverse participation in Alliance objectives we have tokenized them for open enjoyment. See the references for blog posts detailing this. After we have made the offsetting seamless, the Alliance will shift focus to providing a compelling financial product for carbon offset projects looking for a more direct to consumer pathway.

## Phase 1: A clean mainchain
If we do not have an answer to the question of how dirty our underlying blockchain is, many ESG and governmental groups will be excluded by the uncertainty. It doesn't matter that Zilliqa's chain is already efficient regarding its emissions, we have to have a concrete answer - and the best concrete answer we can give is no net carbon. This is more attainable than it seems, my blog post details how close we are to having the entirety of 2021's blocks guilt-free, and this engineering project intends to project those estimates back to the beginning of the chain as well.
